TCaS Mobile
===========
This app allows people to access http://twocansandstring.com/ from their Android phone

The *master* branch will contain the latest stable version of the app once it's finished. 

The *devel* branch contains the latest development of the app. The IDE used is Android Studio.

The *devel-old* contains the old development branch, which is kept in case any of the code on that branch is useful in future. The current devel branch was re-branched from master so that the switch from Eclipse to Android Studio could be done with a clean codebase.
